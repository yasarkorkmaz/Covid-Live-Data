# Covid Live Data
A basic application for Covid-19 live status to learn how to get live data from API services.

I recommended to use your own apikey.

## What can be seen in this app;
* Delegate pattern.
* Swift protocols and extensions.  
* Swift computed properties.
* Swift closures and completion handlers.
* URLSession to network and make HTTP requests.
* Parse JSON with the native Encodable and Decodable protocols.
